# Travel Blog

<p>This is a personal blog about travel adventures. It was built with Bootstrap 4.4 and Django 3.2</p>
<p>This is my first django project</p>
Template was gotten from the <a href="https://bootstrapious.com/" _blank="true">Bootstrapious website</a>.
<p>It has login functionality. Only the admin can create a new user.</p>
<p>The views are function based</p>
